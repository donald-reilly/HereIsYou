HereIsYou is a Python package for deep runtime introspection of Python objects. It exposes constructor signatures, default values, annotations, docstrings, and structural metadata for modules, classes, functions, methods, and properties.

The project originally began as a tool to support dynamic testing, but it has evolved into a personal exploration of Python’s meta‑programming capabilities and runtime internals.

## Overview

HereIsYou is a lightweight introspection engine built to reveal the underlying structure of Python objects. It walks modules, classes, and functions recursively, extracting metadata in a clean, structured format.

This project is still in early development. Each feature added has been part of a broader effort to understand Python’s internals — descriptors, callables, annotations, __dict__ mechanics, and the runtime object model. While the original goal was dynamic test generation, the project now serves as a hands‑on learning tool for exploring Python’s meta‑programming landscape.

## Installation

This package can be installed using pip:

```bash

pip install hereisyou
 
```

## Usage

Usage instructions will be added once the CLI is complete. The interface is currently being reorganized, so examples would be misleading until the structure stabilizes.

---

## Roadmap

- [ ] Add CLI for easy access to introspection features.
- [ ] Implement additional features for broadening the scope of introspection.
- [ ] Put checks in place to measure performance.
- [ ] Optimize performance and handle edge cases.
- [ ] Write comprehensive documentation and usage examples.
- [ ] Explore potential integration with testing frameworks for dynamic test generation.

## Contributing

Nothing setup or planned for contributions as this is strictly for my own personal learning and advancing my knowledge of pythons meta-programming.
